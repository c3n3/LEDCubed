# LEDCubed
LED^3

Hello person who wishes to learn the cube's ways! This will be a BREIF introduction... Basically the situation is as follows: we have a cube, it is a 12 x 12 x 12 cube of RGB LEDs, we have this newly (but probably old when your reading this) created softare architecture that will hopefully stand the test of time (you decide). The things you want to look into are:
  
  App.h -> this contains the workings for how you make an 'App' for the cube, these can be animations, games, anything...
  Basic_Functions.h -> these are the low level functions that allow you to turn LEDs on and change their colors and such
  
If you fully understand what is in those two files you can start making apps. If you have trouble understanding what is going on just contact me, Caden Churchman, if you can possibly get my information (I'm definitly not writting it here).  

*************************
If you want to bypass the whole structure of the code, feel free to comment out the main loop of arduino and just test stuff there.

TODO:
  - Add links or files for the KiCad files that made the circuitry

  - Nest (Wrires)

  - More cool animations

  - 3d tetris

  - 3d minesweeper

  - oscilating 3d graph

  - Glass box

  - Maze/DoomMaze

Done:
  - Optimize code - Done?

  - Rolling Text Display - Done: TypeEngine

  - Stand - Done
  
  - Power inside stand - Done
